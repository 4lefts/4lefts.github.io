    <h1>Process P</h1>
      <h4>By Stephen Ball, 17 August 2016</h4>
    <p>A simple, browser-based drum machine. You can find this app <a href="http://notoperational.com/processp">here</a>, and the source <a href="https://github.com/4lefts/processp">here</a>. It is built using <a href="http://tonejs.org">tonejs</a>.</p>
<p>There are four drums (kick, snare, hat and cymbal), and each is synthesised with sine waves, noise, and filters. It’s quite “normal”, in that it has that 606-vibe. The sequencer runs vertically since it makes more sense that way on a phone, though the buttons are way too big; there’s some work to be done there. It would be good to do a future iteration that used fm/am/ring-mod rather than more “straight” drum synthesis. Ways to alter the number of steps and velocity would be good too, but for a first iteration, I’m pleased.</p>
<p>The performance seems <strong>far</strong> better than using the sound library in <a href="http://p5js.org">p5js</a>, I’m guessing because the implementation there is tied to the processing-style <code>draw()</code> loop? Anyway, sound things are going to use tone from here on out, though a mix of p5 for gui/visualisation and tone for sound is next on the agenda. All gui stuff here is pure html and jQuery.</p>
