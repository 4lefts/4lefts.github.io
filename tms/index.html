			<p><p>A simple program that uses the Thue-Morse sequence to play a random melody.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking and reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-Systems</a> a bit recently, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence">Thue-Morse sequence</a> is not one of them. But it’s kind of similar, to me at least. It’s generated by taking an input string of 1s and 0s, and inverting it, then tacking the inverted version onto the end ot the input string. It does this recursively, starting with a single zero, for 7 iterations. For example 0 -&gt; 01, 01 -&gt; 0110, 0110 -&gt; 01101001, etc.</p>
<p>Notes are chosen from a predefined scale, using a weighted random algorithm (i.e. roots, thirds, fifths and octaves are more likely than other notes). Currently the scale is fized. I should probably work out some GUI-based way to alter it.</p>
<p>The melody is then triggered by the two sequencers as they read the sequence of 1s and 0s in the display. When they get to the end and wrap around, the phase of the second one is offset, kind of poor-man’s Steve Reich style. That was the idea, though it’s not really Reich-y.</p>
<p>There must be loads of applications for sequences like this, and proper L-Systems, for music. This was the first that occured to me. Some kind of pseudo-random/generative percussion synth springs to mind too. </p>
