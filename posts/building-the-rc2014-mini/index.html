    <h1>Building the RC2014 Mini</h1>
      <h4>By Stephen Ball, 11 April 2017</h4>
    <p>The other day I got an <a href="http://rc2014.co.uk">RC2014</a> in the post. The specific kit I got was the <a href="http://rc2014.co.uk/modules/rc2014-mini/">RC2014 Mini</a>. It’s an 8-bit computer based on the z80 microprocessor, and comes with Microsoft BASIC on written on to the first 8KB of it’s ROM, so it should be good to go. As far as I know, this is Grant Searle’s implementation, as detailed <a href="http://searle.hostei.com/grant/z80/SimpleZ80.html#RomBasic">here</a> on his rather excellent site.</p>
<p>I’m too young to have had a z81 when I was little (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">Wikipedia</a> they were discontinued when I was 4), but I guess this computer will be similar in some ways. It has 32KB RAM though, rather than the 1KB that the z81 came with. Onward.</p>

<p>The kit comes with pretty good instructions. They’re printed on black and white, which is fair enough, but means that you can’t tell what colour the resistors are in the pics. Fortunately, there’s a colour version on the <a href="http://rc2014.co.uk/modules/rc2014-mini/">RC2014 Mini page</a>, so you can’t really go far wrong.</p>
<p>First solder in the sockets for the ICs and crystal.</p>

<p>Then the caps…</p>
<p><img src="/images/rc2014-3.jpg" alt="rc2014 mini kit contents"></p>
<p>… and the resistors. Take your time with this; I imagine it would be easy to mix up the colours, if, like me, you don’t spend a lot of time around charts of resistor colour codes.</p>

<p>Next, put in the reset switch, power LED and the power barrel connector. I made a bit of the a hash of this - it’s the only bit that’s not quite straight (though only a tiny bit). Fortunately, you can’t see the fluxy mess on the other side of the board, and anyway, bokeh covers a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>ICs installed. Bending the pins on the z80 chip gave me some sweaty palms, but that’s just me not being used to it, I guess.</p>

<p>I fitted the 2x20 pin female header to use a Raspberry Pi Zero as a terminal emulator and graphics card, via the PiGFX bare metal image for the Pi, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/fbergama/pigfx">here</a>. Amazingly easy to set up thanks to the excellent instructions in the readme.</p>

<p>First boot! I can’t believe it worked first time! Credit to the excellent, easy to follow instructions. An all round great kit. Now… how to use a 3.5” floppy drive with it…</p>
